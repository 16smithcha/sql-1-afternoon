# Project Summary

In this project we will be practicing inserting and querying data using SQL. We'll make use of a handy online tool called Chinook that we'll use to write SQL online. <a href="http://jxs.me/chinook-web/">Click me</a>

On the left are the Tables with their fields, the right is where we will be writing our queries, and the bottom is where we will see our results.  

Any new tables or records that we add into the database will be removed after you refresh the page.

Use [www.sqlteaching.com](http://www.sqlteaching.com/) or [sqlbolt.com](http://sqlbolt.com/) as resources for the missing keywords you'll need.

## Table - People

### Instructions
1. Create a table called Person that records a person's ID, Name, Age, Height ( in cm ), City, FavoriteColor. 
    * ID should be an auto-incrementing id/primary key - Use type: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT
2. Add 5 different people into the Person database. 
    * Remember to not include the ID because it should auto-increment.
3. List all the people in the Person table by Height from tallest to shortest.
4. List all the people in the Person table by Height from shortest to tallest.
5. List all the people in the Person table by Age from oldest to youngest.
6. List all the people in the Person table older than age 20.
7. List all the people in the Person table that are exactly 18.
8. List all the people in the Person table that are less than 20 and older than 30.
9. List all the people in the Person table that are not 27 (Use not equals).
10. List all the people in the Person table where their favorite color is not red.
11. List all the people in the Person table where their favorite color is not red or blue.
12. List all the people in the Person table where their favorite color is orange or green.
